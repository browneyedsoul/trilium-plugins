## How to Use

1. Create a new **Code Note** in Trilium.
2. Set the note type to `JS Frontend`.
3. Paste the plugin code into the note.
4. Add the label `#widget` to that note.
5. That's it! it should be refreshed to be worked in your trilium worksapce. Enjoy!

## Troubleshooting

- If nothing shows up, confirm the note is **JS Frontend** (not JS Backend).
- Confirm the label is exactly `#widget`.
- Try reloading Trilium (or switching notes) once.
